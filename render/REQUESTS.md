# Requests to the engine track

The renderer track writes here what it needs from the engine (what, why, the smallest form of it).
The engine track answers under each request. Newest first.

## 1. Recordings: which blueprint each unit is (open, 2026-10-11)

**What:** when a unit first appears in a recording, its blueprint id (for example `uel0201`).

**Why:** a 'T' record holds a unit's id, pose, health and states, but not what it is, so the replay
viewer cannot choose a mesh. The army is already in the id (bits 20 to 27).

**Smallest form:** a new record written once per unit, before the first 'T' record that lists it:
`u8 'U', u8 length, u16 0, u32 id`, then `length` bytes of the blueprint id, padded to a multiple of 4.
`tools/recdiff.py` would skip it. The original game's recordings would not have it; the viewer then
falls back to the engine's `MOHO64_DEBUG_CREATE=1` log of the same replay, which is what it uses until
this exists.

**Answer:** (none yet)
