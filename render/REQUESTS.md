# Requests to the engine track

The renderer track writes here what it needs from the engine (what, why, the smallest form of it).
The engine track answers under each request. Newest first.

## 2. What the viewer cannot show from a recording (not urgent, 2026-10-11)

For planning the live frame, not a request to change the recorder now. The replay viewer draws units
where the recording puts them; these are the things it has no data for, in the order they are missed
when watching a battle:

1. **Bone poses.** Turrets, barrels, legs, unfolding parts: every model stands in its rest pose. The
   smallest useful form in a live frame: per unit, the bones whose pose differs from the rest pose
   (bone index, position and rotation relative to the unit).
2. **Projectiles and beams.** Id, blueprint, position, orientation; for beams the two end points.
3. **Army facts.** Colour and faction per army (the viewer uses a fixed colour list by army index).
4. **Props that change.** Trees reclaimed or knocked over, wreckage created: the viewer draws the map
   file's props as they were at the start.
5. **Construction.** `fractionComplete` is there; the builder and the build beams are not.

`render/frame.h` holds the structure the renderer fills from a recording today; when the engine side
is ready to hand over frames, tell here which of the above it can give and the header is extended to
match.

## 1. Recordings: which blueprint each unit is (open, 2026-10-11)

**What:** when a unit first appears in a recording, its blueprint id (for example `uel0201`).

**Why:** a 'T' record holds a unit's id, pose, health and states, but not what it is, so the replay
viewer cannot choose a mesh. The army is already in the id (bits 20 to 27).

**Smallest form:** a new record written once per unit, before the first 'T' record that lists it:
`u8 'U', u8 length, u16 0, u32 id`, then `length` bytes of the blueprint id, padded to a multiple of 4.
`tools/recdiff.py` would skip it. The original game's recordings would not have it; the viewer then
falls back to the engine's `MOHO64_DEBUG_CREATE=1` log of the same replay, which is what it uses until
this exists.
