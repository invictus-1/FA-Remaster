# The modern look's lighting, pushed further

Chris, 2026-10-16: start now (renderer only; with the engine on multicore when it needs the renderer):
volumetric light and fog; volumetric clouds and a better sky; real reflections (screen space, then ray
traced); bounce light (probes, ray traced); soft and contact shadows; rain and snow upgrades (with the
visuals chat's art). No full path tracing. Every piece is a player option, OFF by default, with today's
look as the fallback when it is off or fails; each is measured against the 60 fps budget (RTX 4090 at
1440p, `--timings`) before it is turned on anywhere. Ray tracing on Direct3D 12 and Vulkan (Windows,
Linux); macOS has none (MoltenVK offers no ray queries): the README is to say "ray tracing unavailable on
Mac", and every ray-traced effect keeps a fallback without it.

## What the modern look has today (2026-10-16)

- Surfaces: physically based (GGX, metal and roughness as the LabPBR maps give them), lit by the sun or the
  moon and by the sky (the sky's cube map with blurrier levels for rougher surfaces).
- The sky: computed (single scattering, Rayleigh, Mie and ozone; stars, the moon), clouds a 2D layer of
  noise (`CloudField`, `CloudShadow` in view.h) at 150 above the ground's zero.
- Shadows: the sun's cascades (comparison sampler, four nearest blended); the eight nearest lamps' shadow
  maps; thousands of small lights in a flat grid over the ground (lights.h).
- Ambient occlusion in screen space (ambient_occlusion.cpp); reflections of the sky's cube map only.
- The air: haze (`ThroughAir`) and mist on low ground (`MistLost`), computed per surface in every shader
  (`ThroughAirTo`, view.h); lamp shafts as billboards (shafts.cpp).
- Weather: rain and snow falling, wetness, puddles, lying snow and its tracks.
- After: HDR, exposure, a filmic curve, bloom, FSR 1 when drawn smaller than the screen; 4 samples a pixel
  (MSAA) by default.

## The order of work

0. **Groundwork.**
   - **Done** (2026-10-16): compute shaders in gfx (`CreateCompute`, `SetStorage`, `Dispatch`); storage
     targets (`TargetDesc::storage`), 2D or volumes (`depth`), with levels (`mips`); `Format::RG16F`. Both
     backends; `--gfx-check` tries them and reads the results back (both pass, Direct3D 12's debug layer
     silent; also with `--fxc`).
   - **Done** (2026-10-16): sixteen storage slots, R32UI (atomics), RGBA32F, R8 writable (FSR 3 needs them).
   - **Done** (2026-10-16): motion (`render/motion.h`): where each pixel was last frame, the camera's part
     from the depth and last frame's matrices (ground, scenery, water, sky), moving units and entities
     drawn again from their place and bones of the frame before (MeshRenderer keeps them by key). Checked
     with `--motion-view 2|3 --msaa 1 --pan dx,dz`: a panned still scene carried from the frame before
     matches (mean 3 in 255, 95 % within 12; what is left: the edge coming in, trees in the wind); in a
     battle the units' own motion takes the error from 0.88 % of the picture to 0.67 %. Vulkan as
     Direct3D 12. Also `Post::KeepOpaque` / `Reactive` (the upscaler's reactive mask) and the finishing
     passes at any picture's size.
   - **In work**: AMD's FSR 3.1 upscaler (`render/fsr3.h`; the FidelityFX SDK v2.3.0's MIT sources, the
     download approved by Chris on 2026-10-16), ported by a helper onto gfx's compute shaders. Its temporal
     anti-aliasing replaces MSAA where it is on (the scene then drawn with one sample a pixel and a jitter).
1. **Light in the air** (volumetric fog): a volume over the view (froxels, about 160 x 90 x 64), the sun
   through its shadow cascades and the clouds' shadow, the lamps from the light grid, haze and mist as
   densities; reprojected and blended over frames, then summed toward the eye. Every shader's
   `ThroughAirTo` reads it in place of today's formulas when it is on, so particles and water get it too.
   Lamp shafts then come out of the volume itself.
   - **First version done** (2026-10-16): `render/air.h/.cpp`, `World::volumetricFog` (viewer `--air`;
     tuning `--air-dust`, `--air-sun`, `--air-lamps`, `--air-cells across,deep`). 160 x 90 x 64 cells
     (RGBA16F), sampled at another depth in each cell every frame and blended with last frame's (0.9).
     Haze and the air's own dust thin over 300 units above the map's middle height (else the sky, seen
     through the whole volume, went grey); the mist as the formulas had it. The lamps' beams are
     strengthened 150 times on the clear air's dust alone (mist and fog scatter them as they are), the
     other small lights (explosions' flashes, glows) 15 times, a beam's glow to all sides a quarter
     (all of it made coloured halos). The sky is seen through the whole volume; particles, trails and
     the water through their own place in it.
   - Cost (`--timings`, 1440p, RTX 4090, Seton's at night): the volume 0.05-0.09 ms; the frame 2.78 ->
     2.85 ms on average (the median within noise). Finer cells are affordable (to try: 240 x 128).
   - Off: pictures identical to the build before, pixel for pixel, on both backends. On: Vulkan as
     Direct3D 12 (mean difference 0.07-0.19 in 255).
   - Open: the lamp shafts' billboards (shafts.cpp) are still drawn with it on; in the fog weather the
     sky goes pale behind the volume (as real fog would make it), which is Chris's to judge.
2. **Clouds and the sky**: clouds as volumes (noise volumes made once by compute shaders, marched at a
   quarter of the pixels and filled in over frames), their shadows on the ground from the same clouds; the
   sky from tables of the atmosphere computed when the time of day changes (transmittance, multiple
   scattering, the sky's view, the air's own light over distance).
   - **Clouds: first version done** (2026-10-16): `render/clouds.h/.cpp`, `World::volumetricClouds` (viewer
     `--clouds-3d`; `--clouds-full` marches at the picture's own size, no sharper: the softness is the
     shapes'). Noise made once: Perlin-Worley shapes 128 cubed (stretched over 0..1: it lands between
     0.62 and 0.95, and unstretched every place was cloud and the outlines were the coverage's alone) and
     Worley detail 32 cubed. Coverage from the field today's cloud shadows use (CloudField, CloudFrom),
     laid in a 512 x 512 picture over 16,000 units round the camera each frame; the shapes cut it at 60 %
     of the coverage. Shadows: through the layer toward the sun from its underside (150 over the ground's
     zero, not following the camera), read by CloudShadow for every lit surface and the light in the air.
     The view marched at half the width and height, 64 steps, only where the sky shows; light toward the
     sun in 5 growing steps, a floor for light scattered on inside; two-lobed phase (bright edges toward
     the sun); the sky's light from round about by height; blended 0.85 with the frame before by
     direction. Lit by `SkyLight::cloudSun`: at their height the sun sets about two degrees later than on
     the ground, so at 18:12 they glow red over a dark dusk.
   - Cost (1440p, RTX 4090, half the view sky): shadows 0.06 ms, clouds 0.21 ms, the sky then 0.14 ms;
     today's sky with its own layer 0.63 ms. Off: pictures as before; on, Vulkan as Direct3D 12.
   - Open: the sky's tables of the atmosphere (the sky today already scatters per pixel); the clouds'
     shapes are soft at a distance (Chris to judge).
3. **Soft shadows** (the sun's penumbra wider with distance from the caster) and **contact shadows** (a
   short march along the depth toward the light, for the small creases the shadow maps cannot hold).
4. **Ray tracing**: inline ray queries (Direct3D 12's DXR 1.1, shader model 6.5; Vulkan's
   VK_KHR_ray_query), a structure per model's level of detail and one for the ground, the scene's built
   each frame. Then reflections on every surface, bounce light (probes over the map updated by rays a few
   at a time) and, optional, ray-traced shadows. Each keeps its fallback.
   (Reflections were step 3 in screen space. Changed on 2026-10-16: the water already mirrors what is
   around it in screen space (water.cpp: a march along the scene's depth, sampling the picture behind);
   for metal and wet ground a screen-space pass needs each pixel's normal and roughness, which this
   renderer, drawing each surface whole in one pass, does not keep. Rays cast by the surfaces' own
   shaders need none of that and also see what is off screen.)
5. **Rain and snow** with the visuals chat's art: streaks lit by the lamps and the volume, splashes,
   ripples on puddles and water, snow gathering on the ground and on units.

## The options

All in `World`, off by default, each one's cost measured and written here when it is built:
`volumetricFog`, `volumetricClouds`, `skyTables`, `screenReflections`, `softShadows`, `contactShadows`,
`rayTracing` (with `rtReflections`, `rtBounceLight`, `rtShadows`), and the rain and snow upgrades. The ui
chat gets the names and their costs when each is ready.
